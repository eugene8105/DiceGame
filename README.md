Rules:
The game has 2 players. A player rolls dice as many times as the player wants. Each result gets added to the player round score. If the player rolls a 1, all his points from that round get lost and another player starts rolling. The player can choose to keep the points from the round with pushing a 'Hold' button. Who gets 100 points first will win the game.
